# Bank-Churn
Modelling Bank Churn (Machine Learning Application)
The dataset contains customer information, including demographics, account details, and transaction history, which are used to train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of customers leaving the bank. The aim of the project is to identify key factors contributing to churn and provide actionable insights to reduce customer attrition.

Here are the questions I was interested in answering:
1. What are the primary factors that influence bank customer churn?
2. How accurately can customer churn be predicted using machine learning models?
3. Which machine learning algorithm performs best in predicting churn?
4. What strategies can be implemented to retain customers identified as high-risk for churn?
**I took the following steps to create my analysis:**
1. Collected and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
2. Explored the data through visualization to identify patterns and correlations.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. Applied and compared various machine learning algorithms to predict churn.
5. Validated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Here are my key takeaways:
1. Customer demographics and transaction history significantly impact churn rates.
2.The Random Forest algorithm provided the most accurate predictions of customer churn
3. Implementing targeted retention strategies based on model predictions can effectively reduce churn rates.
